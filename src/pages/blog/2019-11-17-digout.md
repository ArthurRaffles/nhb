The barn has an old concrete floor laid on top of earth. In order to get the required head-height, floor insulation and strength we are breaking up the old floor and digging down approx 1m. 

Then we'll installed a new reinforced floor slab.

Sue standing in the kitchen after the concrete and earth removed. You can see one of the old windows that were bricked up at some point. These will be opened up again.

Back of the kitchen, there's another bricked up window behind the door. Acroprops holding up the wooden structure above it!
