After about 8 weeks of legal wrangling we've bought the barn!

It's in good shape generally as it had the roof renewed in the last 5 years. Inside it has the original floors and some of the threshing 
machinery.

![original plans](/img/blog/original-plans.png)
Plans - The barn came with residential PP, this included the addiotion of an extension on the back. There are some parts of the existing
PP that we don't like and will try to change, such as the position of the extension, retention of threshing doors and ugly glazing in 
threshing door hole.

Front of the barn with original threshing doors. These are rotten and will hopefully go. This will be replaced with glazing, 
approx 3.5 * 4.5 m.

Ground floor - going to be study (the tender will have to go).

![void](/img/blog/purchased/IMG3.jpg)
First floor looking into the void - The void will be entrance hall and contain the stairs. The boarded up door
is the rear threshing door.

Top floor - photo taken from first floor (can't get to top floor as no stairs) looking at top floor/ roof space. Top floor will be turned into
2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.

First floor - Looking across the void. Each side of the central void will contain a bedroom and bathroom.

first floor - Looking at where the bathroom is going - needs a bit of tidying before work starts.

Ground floor - looking at the kitchen. You can make out some old window openings that are bricked up. These will be re-opened.

Outside back - looking at the back of the barn. You can see the smaller threshing door which will be glazed.
