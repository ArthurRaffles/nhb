It's taken a while, but we have **most** of the planning amendments we were hoping for.

In April we submitted updated plans for the barn. The process has taken a barely believable three and a half months!

There have been two main bottlenecks; the first being the fact it's in an AONB and had lost all its [permitted development rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Permitted_Development_Order) as part of the orignal planning permission. The second being the planing process is fairly tortuous and lacks any transparency.

Below is the original permitted elevations.

The main changes we asked for are:

- Moving the extension to the south end of the barn to improve the view from the rear threshing door.
- Addition of extra windows in the extension in the direction of the main view. Strangely, the orginal PP only had one window in the direction of the best view from the barn.
- Changed the end window in the extension.
- Added an extra window on the back of the barn to allow light in to hallway.
- Changed the materials used in the extension and updated the appearance to be more modern. The extension will now be timber clad with a zinc roof, previously it was brick and pan-tile.
- Removed excessive glazing bars on threshing door glazing.

New agreed elevations.

The changes we didn't get:
- A garage. We are going to try and get this as a separate application.
- Roof lights.
