The builders started this week. 4 chaps on site (Richard, Steve, xx, xx), first jobs are to clear out all the rubbish (hay, straw, an old boat, all the rotten frame and floors etc etc.) in the barn.

It's the first time we've seen the main threshing doors open, nice to get a better idea of the size. You can see the central void which will house the stairs and a bridge linking the two sides upstairs.

Next job is to break up the floor. It's got a concrete floor at the moment, but we need to break it up in order to gain some extra head height on the first floor and to add insulation and under-floor heating on the ground floor.

Old frame - shame it's got to go but it's mostly rotten and/or wormy. We also need to move the first floor floor doww a few inches to gain head height.

You can see some of the rot at the top of the photo. The roof was in a poor state for a while and it caused a lot of damage to interior timbers. Thankfully, the previous owner put a new roof on a few years ago to limit the damage.

The roof structure itself is sound, so we are hoping to leave it alone..

First floor looking across to second bedroom and bathroom. Lookily the front of the barn resembles a domestic residence with a large number of window openings. Therefore, one of the problems associated with barns, lack of light away from the main door, is not such a problem here. 

We have permission to add another opening at the back of the barn on the first floor - RHS of this photo.

There was a metal tank inside, which the builders are cutting up. We think it was used for water storage and was home to a number of our (dead) furry friends.
